### Current project:
- Working on [my second implementation of a regular expression parser](https://github.com/AmyShackles/regular_expression_parser), my first implmentation available [here](https://github.com/AmyShackles/parse_regex).  The general goal of the project is to be able to create a VSCode extension where a person can highlight a regular expression and have the extension generate a description of what that regular expression is matching against and append that to the end of the selected line as a code comment.  (The VSCode extension part of the plan is available [here](https://github.com/AmyShackles/vscode_extension_parseregex))

### Educational Pursuits:
- Taking a course in computer security through [Roppers Academy](https://www.hoppersroppers.org/)

### About Me
I love solving other people's problems. It was the pursuit of this love that led me to double major in Psychology and Anthropology and what made the pivot to software engineering an exciting and rewarding one. While I don't use my college degree in a traditional sense, the communication and conflict resolution skills I acquired bring value to any team I'm a part of, as does my ability to see a situation from multiple perspectives at once.

Before switching to a career in software development and engineering, I worked remotely in the transcription industry for a decade. Ever the generalist, I transcribed for companies working on digitizing oral histories, academic research, insurance interviews and investigations, police investigations, captioning work for television shows and extra feature content for feature films, medical dictation... you name it, I've probably transcribed it. I don't list these to brag, but to prove a point. It is mission critical for transcripts to be as accurate as possible. Though it wasn't always easy, I always made it a point to research industry-specific terminology, even going as far as figuring out foreign phrases if they had been used by a speaker to communicate a story (I transcribed a rabbi once who said a phrase in Hebrew and after a bit of sleuthing managed to find a previous talk he'd given where he'd said the same phrase, so that I could include it in the transcript rather than inserting a <foreign language> tag). Researching, to me, is second nature. I'm the type of person that if someone starts a sentence with "I wonder if...", if I am not physically restrained from doing so, I'm going to be finding the answer to that query.

This comes in handy in tech, where there are so many problems to solve and while there are some _bad_ solutions to problems, there's no definite _good_ solutions (at least not normally). While I don't know everything, I do have the capacity to figure out anything -- and the passion and drive to go with it.

If you're looking for someone who:
- will always offer to help, even going as far as learning an entirely new language and framework in order to make a deadline
- works well independently and as part of a team
- is constantly learning and teaching others
- shares cat photos
